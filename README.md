# DATA-KING  
> Data Engineering. ETL. Big Data. Cloud Pipelines.

Welcome to **DATA-KING** — the Data Engineering version of “Backend-King”.  
This repository is not about APIs, microservices, or backend frameworks.  
This is about **data pipelines, transformations, analytics platforms, and cloud-scale ETL systems**.

Think of this as a hands-on lab for mastering **modern Data Engineering** using Python, Spark, Snowflake, Databricks, Alteryx, Talend, and all major cloud providers.
